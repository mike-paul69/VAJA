package employee;
import java.util.Scanner;
class employee_Sal_Inc
{
private int id;
private String name;
private double salary;
public employee_Sal_Inc(int id, String name, double salary)
{
 this.id = id;
 this.name = name;
 this.salary = salary;
}
public void raiseSalary(double percent)
{
 salary += salary * percent / 100;
}

public String toString()
{
// return "details = " + id + name + salary ;
 return "Employee{" + "id=" + id + ", name='" + name + '\'' +
", salary=" + salary + '}';
}
}
class Employee_main
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
employee_Sal_Inc employee = new employee_Sal_Inc(1,
"John", 50000);
System.out.println("Employee before salary increase: " +
employee);
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter the percentage increment for
the employee:");
employee.raiseSalary(sc.nextDouble());
System.out.println("Employee after salary increase: " +
